# FinalProject_beta
My final project from CodersLab Java Web Developer Course. It's the same project as "FinalProject" but transformed from Java spring MVC into Java Spring Boot project with few more improvements.

You can access it at: http://46.101.143.150:8082/

The idea of the app came from my fiancee who recently started to act as a sole trader. She's a physiotherapist and she told me it would be helpfull for her to have an app to store patient data and their documentation and above all to have some kind of schedule/calendar of her visits. So that's what that app is all about.

Technologies and tools I've used in the app:
-Spring Boot
-Hibernate
-Validation
-MySql
-JavaScrip, JQuery
-Bootstrap
-jsp, jstl

To download and run your app on your computer you have to create your own database and replace "your_db_name", "your_username", "your_password" in application.properties file.
